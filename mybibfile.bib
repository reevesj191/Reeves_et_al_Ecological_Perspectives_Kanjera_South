  abstract = {The systematic archaeological and geological survey and excavations at Gona between 1992\textendash 1994 led to the discovery of well-flaked stone artefacts which are currently the oldest known from anywhere in the world. More than 3000 surface and excavated artefacts were recovered at 15 localities documented east and west of the Kada Gona river. Based on radioisotopic dating (40Ar/39Ar) and magnetostratigraphy, the artefacts are dated between 2{$\cdot$}6\textendash 2{$\cdot$}5 million years ago (Ma). EG10 and EG12 from East Gona are the most informative with the highest density, providing the best opportunity for characterizing the oldest assemblages and for understanding the stone working capability of the earliest tool makers. Slightly younger artefact occurrences dated to 2{$\cdot$}4\textendash 2{$\cdot$}3Ma are known from Hadar and Omo in Ethiopia, and from Lokalalei in Kenya. Cut-marked bones dated to 2{$\cdot$}5Ma from Bouri in Ethiopia are now providing important clues on the function of these artefacts. In addition, Australopithecus garhi known from contemporary deposits at Bouri may be the best candidate responsible for the oldest artefacts. Surprisingly, the makers of the Gona artefacts had a sophisticated understanding of stone fracture mechanics and control similar to what is observed for Oldowan assemblages dated between 2{$\cdot$}0\textendash 1{$\cdot$}5Ma. This observation was corroborated by the recent archaeological discoveries made at Lokalalei. Because of the similarities seen in the techniques of artefact manufacture during the Late Pliocene\textendash Early Pleistocene, it is argued here that the stone assemblages dated between 2{$\cdot$}6\textendash 1{$\cdot$}5Ma group into the Oldowan Industry. The similarity and simplicity of the artefacts from this time interval suggests a technological stasis in the Oldowan.},

  abstract = {The manufacture of flaked stone artifacts represents a major milestone in the technology of the human lineage. Although the earliest production of primitive stone tools, predating the genus Homo and emphasizing percussive activities, has been reported at 3.3 million years ago (Ma) from Lomekwi, Kenya, the systematic production of sharp-edged stone tools is unknown before the 2.58\textendash 2.55 Ma Oldowan assemblages from Gona, Ethiopia. The organized production of Oldowan stone artifacts is part of a suite of characteristics that is often associated with the adaptive grade shift linked to the genus Homo. Recent discoveries from Ledi-Geraru (LG), Ethiopia, place the first occurrence of Homo {$\sim$}250 thousand years earlier than the Oldowan at Gona. Here, we describe a substantial assemblage of systematically flaked stone tools excavated in situ from a stratigraphically constrained context [Bokol Dora 1, (BD 1) hereafter] at LG bracketed between 2.61 and 2.58 Ma. Although perhaps more primitive in some respects, quantitative analysis suggests the BD 1 assemblage fits more closely with the variability previously described for the Oldowan than with the earlier Lomekwian or with stone tools produced by modern nonhuman primates. These differences suggest that hominin technology is distinctly different from generalized tool use that may be a shared feature of much of the primate lineage. The BD 1 assemblage, near the origin of our genus, provides a link between behavioral adaptations\textemdash in the form of flaked stone artifacts\textemdash and the biological evolution of our ancestors.},

Work in West Turkana and Gona research areas suggests that Pliocene hominins had a concise understanding of stone fracture mechanics and had a clear conception of how to reduce cores in a manner that maintained flaking surfaces. Here we investigate if these same patterns existed at the Pliocene site of Kanjera South in Western Kenya. Technological analyses suggest that although many of the technological capabilities described for other Oldowan sites are present in the Kanjera South assemblage, specific aspects of the context of the site (raw material variability) produced a different expression of these behaviors. The most obvious difference between the Kanjera South site and other Oldowan sites is that as reduction continues several different reduction patterns can be seen. This suggests that a reduction sequence or core reduction mode is not an immutable formula and can change depending on its context.},

  abstract = {Relatively few remains of Late Pliocene hominids' knapping activities have been recovered to date, and these have seldom been studied in terms of manual dexterity and technical achievements. With regard to early hominid technological development, the evidence provided by the data from 2.34 Myr site of Lokalalei 2C (Kenya) questions both the prior assumption of a continuous and linear evolutionary trend in lithic production and the idea that it long remained static. The level of elaboration evinced by the lithic assemblage is quite unexpected in view of its age, and seemingly more advanced that what can be surmised for other Late Pliocene East-African sites, including the nearby site of Lokalalei 1. Analysis relies mainly on the dynamic reconstruction of entire cobble reduction sequences from particularly informative refitting groups. The Lokalalei 2C knappers had already internalised the notion of planning and foresight in raw material procurement and management. Beyond simple mastery of the basic technical constraints peculiar to stone knapping, they conducted a highly controlled de\textasciiacute bitage of flakes following constant technical rules and resulting in high productivity. The data suggest that early hominids displayed distinct technical competencies and techno-economic patterns of behavior, thus pointing to an intrasite complexity and intersite diversity which are not accounted for by the existing chrono-cultural classifications.},

While the same local conglomerate was used as a raw material source for both archaeological occurrences, different selection criteria are identified. At A.L. 894, selection for quality is subtle and the clearest selection is against non-homogeneous raw materials. In the A.L. 666 assemblage, higher-quality raw materials were selected and some rare raw materials reached the locality from unknown sources. A~comparison between the Makaamitalu and other Oldowan assemblages reveals an overall shift toward higher complexity of both selectivity and transport behaviors from ca. 2.0~Ma onward, contrasting a typo-technological conservatism that pertains until {$\sim$}1.6~Ma. It is hypothesized that an increase in complexity of behaviors related to raw material selection and acquisition involved changes in the intensity and fidelity of technological knowledge transmission.},

This is contradicted by the results of systematic studies of raw material availability and use among the earliest known archaeological sites from Gona, Afar, Ethiopia. Artifact assemblages from six Pliocene archaeological sites were compared with six random cobble samples taken from associated conglomerates that record pene-contemporaneous raw material availability. Artifacts and cobbles were evaluated according to four variables intended to capture major elements of material quality: rock type, phenocryst percentage, average phenocryst size, and groundmass texture. Analyses of these variables provide evidence of hominid selectivity for raw material quality. These results demonstrate that raw material selectivity was a potential component of Oldowan technological organization from its earliest appearance and document a level of technological sophistication that is not always attributed to Pliocene hominids.},

  abstract = {The late Pliocene is notable for the appearance of two new hominid genera as well as the first archaeological sites, generally attributed to the Oldowan Industrial Complex. However, the behavioral ecology of Oldowan hominids has been little explored, particularly at sites older than 2{$\cdot$}0Ma. Moreover, debates on Oldowan hominid foraging ecology and behavior have centered on data from only two regions, and often from single site levels. Here we describe the preliminary results of our investigation of Oldowan occurrences at Kanjera South. These occurrences preserve the oldest known traces of hominid activity in southwestern Kenya, and unlike most of the Oldowan sites in the 2{$\cdot$}0\textendash 2{$\cdot$}5Ma time interval, artefacts are found in spatial association with a well-preserved fauna. In 1996 and 1997, this project initiated the first excavation program for Kanjera South. Magneto- and biostratigraphy indicate that deposition began approximately 2{$\cdot$}2Ma, substantially earlier than previously thought. At Excavation 1, artefacts were found in spatial association with a taxonomically diverse faunal assemblage in Beds KS-1 and KS-2. Excavation 2 yielded a partial hippopotamus axial skeleton with artefacts in KS-3. Cores from both sites were incidentally flaked and represent a Mode I lithic technology indistinguishable from the Oldowan. Approximately 15\% of the artefacts were manufactured from non-local raw materials, indicating a flow of resources into the area. Stable isotopic analysis of KS-1 and KS-2 pedogenic carbonates suggests that the Excavation 1 assemblages formed in a relatively open ({$>$}75\% C4grass) habitat. The Excavation 1 and 2 faunas contain a high proportion of equids relative to Oldowan accumulations from Bed I Olduvai Gorge, Tanzania. Beds KS-1 and KS-2 thus preserve traces of Oldowan hominid activities in a more open setting than has been previously documented.},
